Each week you can hunt for a certain monster on the map.
When you visist the town you will see in a splash screen this weeks bounty. Each killed creature is worth a certain gold amount. Kill as many as you can and then return to the city and hand in your reward.
Additionally to gold you will a certain chance to gain other rewards as well. The more challenging the monster you have hunted is, the higher the chance for more and better loot.*
